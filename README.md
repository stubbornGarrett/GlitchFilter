# What GlitchFilter does
It takes an image and applys multiple filters to it.

# How it works
1. Load an image *"File -> Open Image"* or *"Ctrl + O"*
2. Activate filters you want to use in *"Active Filter List"*
3. Select filters from the list to show their paramters
4. Adjust parameters
5. Hit *"Apply Changes"*

To get a first impression skip 2,3 and 4. The default parameters should look fine on most pictures

# Why I made GlitchFilter
I love Sci-Fi and Cyberpunk and the look of destroyed, glitchy images from this genres. For this I wanted an application which could create such images with less effort, than editing them by myself.

GlitchFilter is far from perfect and I got many ideas to improve it. But for now I'm publishing this more or less stable version.
It's the first "real" application I made and I learned a lot while doing so. Maybe the next version will be a complete rework.

The only thing I'm really sorry for is the GUI. It's by no means intuitive and the parameter names are sometimes not really meaningful. A documentation is on the to do list.
